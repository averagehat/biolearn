I wanted to etch the parabolic curve of Revolution on the inner wall of my mind but I couldn’t 

concentrate between my sister crying and my father blasting God Bless the USA, which had been 

playing incessantly all through the Moscow Olympics. Mom and I couldn't stand the song, but we 

didn't dare ask him to change the dial. Elyse whined: when will we be back home? Can we go back 

home? 

“Do you know how much this trip cost us?” my father asked her. “I'll tell you.” 

We stayed quiet while he worked out the mileage in his head. It's the long division that always 

gives him trouble; he should drop the remainder, but if he's not accurate down to the cent he's not 

satisfied. 

Sis and I were doing our best to enjoy our time away from school. The spring semester in our 

little jails of learning had brought a parade of paperwork and unsolicited psychiatric suggestions. The 

teachers weren't satisfied keeping us locked up in a classroom all day; they wanted to confine our 

minds as well. 

The high sun, the purring motor, and Dad's intense focus formed a delicate economy of heat and 

propulsion that left little room for the remainder. I dropped my arithmetic ambition and the motor 

released a satisfied hiss. 

I watched my sister, who wanted to know if tigers lived in the desert. Her arms had just grown 

long enough to grab Mom's elbow with her malformed fingers. Mom ignored her, watching Dad, who 

stared straight ahead, trying to squeeze the quotient out the space between his eyes. 

“It doesn't matter anyway,” he said, “we've gone too far to turn back. Piss out the window, or 

hold it in.”
